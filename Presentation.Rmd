## Introduction {.smaller}
  - Car accidents happen every day. 
  - There are many reasons for two or more cars colliding.

## Data set {.smaller} 
- The data used in this project is a report from Monroe County, Indiana. It includes more than 53.000 accidents reported from 2003 to 2015.
```{r load-sas-libraries, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}

library(SASmarkdown)
sas_enginesetup(sashtml=sashtml)

sasexe <- "C:/Program Files/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe"
sasopts <- "-nosplash -ls 75"

# Linux options (for grading, please leave this in!)
# sasexe <- "/usr/local/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/bin/sas_en"
# sasopts <- "-ls 75"
```
```{r, engine="sashtml", engine.path=sasexe, engine.opts=sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ODS HTML STYLE=HTMLBLUE;
filename dat "monroe-county-crash-data2003-to-2015.csv";
PROC IMPORT DATAFILE = dat OUT = Crash
    DBMS = CSV 
    REPLACE; 
    GETNAMES = YES;
    GUESSINGROWS = 5000;
RUN;
proc print data= Crash (obs=5);
var Year Month Day Hour Collision_Type Injury_Type Primary_Factor;
run;
```


## Topic Ideas: {.smaller}
- Some questions I want to find out through the data include:
  + Which year has the highest rate of accident? On what month? Is that month consistent for all other years? 
  + Is there any specific day (or month, year) with more accidents than the other day (month/ year)? 
  + On that day (month/ year), what is the primary factor that causes the accident? What are the highest injuries? 
  
## Total Accidents By Years {.smaller}
- We see that 2003 have the highest accidents compare to other years.  
- 
```{r, fig.width= 8, `results = FALSE`, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
Crash <- read_csv("monroe-county-crash-data2003-to-2015.csv")
YE <- table(Crash$Year)
YE
ggplot(Crash, aes(x = Year)) + 
  geom_bar(fill="steelblue")+
  geom_text(aes(Year, 6000, label=Year))+
  theme_minimal()
```
