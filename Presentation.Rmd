## Introduction {.smaller}
  - Automobiles are an indispensable part of life. 
  - Thanks to them that travel, transaction, business, and even medical problems has been improving.
  - But they also carry risks that affect human life.

## Monroe County {.smaller} 
- Part of the Bloomington, Indiana.
- It was formed in 1818, and named after the fifth President of the United States, James Monroe.
- The 2010 United States Census report that the population was 137,974.
- The total area is 411.32 square miles, which 95.91% is land and 4.09% is water.


## Data explornation {.smaller}
- Accidents reported in Monroe County from 2003 to 2015.
- More than 53.000 cases.
- Some factors:
  + Day/ Month/ Year/ Hour (that accidents occurred). 
  + Collision type: Type of vehicles involved?  
  + Injury Types: Fatal, incapacitating, no injury/ unknown, and non-incapacitating.
  + Primary factors that cause accidents: Following too closely, unsafe backing, etc.


## Topic Ideas: {.smaller}
- Some questions I want to find out through the data include:
  + Which year has the highest rate of accident? On what month? Is that month consistent for all other years? 
  + Is there any specific day (or month, year) with more accidents than the other day (month/ year)? 
  + On that day (month/ year), what is the primary factor that causes the accident? What are the highest injuries? 
  + What can we conclude about driving habit of citizen of Monroe county?

## Year {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tmp %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="brown") + 
  geom_text(aes(label=count), vjust=1.6, color="white", size=3.5)+
  ggtitle("Which year has the highest rate accidents?") +
  theme_minimal()
  
```


  
## Month {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p<-tmp %>%
  group_by(Month, Year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = count)) + 
  geom_line(aes(frame=Year))+
  ggtitle("Accidents month by month") 
ggplotly(p)

```

## Day and time {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
p<-tmp %>%
  group_by(hour, `wday`, Year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = count, color = `wday`)) + 
  geom_line(aes(frame = Year))+
  ggtitle("Day and time")
ggplotly(p)

```



## Weekday or weekend? {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
p<-tmp %>%
  group_by(hour, `Weekend?`, Year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = count, color = `Weekend?`)) + 
  geom_line(aes(frame = Year))+
  ggtitle("Weekend or weekdays?")
ggplotly(p)

```

## Injury types {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
p<-tmp %>%
  group_by(hour, `Injury Type`, Year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = count, color = `Injury Type`)) + 
  geom_line(aes(frame = Year))+
  ggtitle("Type of injuries")
ggplotly(p)

```

## How many vehicles involved? {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
p<-tmp %>%
  group_by(hour, `Collision Type`, Year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = count, color = `Collision Type`)) + 
  geom_line(aes(frame = Year))+
  ggtitle("Vehicles involved")
ggplotly(p)

```

## Causes of accidents {.smaller}

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(tmp, aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(`Primary Factor`)))) + 
  geom_bar(fill="steelblue")+
  ggtitle("Causes of accidents, 2003 to 2015") +
  theme_minimal()+ coord_flip()
```

## Causes of accidents (continue) {.smaller}

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(Month, aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(`Primary Factor`)))) + 
  geom_bar(fill="darkgreen")+
  ggtitle("Causes of accidents, 2003") +
  theme_minimal()+ coord_flip()
```

## Causes of accidents (continue) {.smaller}

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(Mo, aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(`Primary Factor`)))) + 
  geom_bar(fill="steelblue")+
  ggtitle("Causes of accidents, 2011") +
  theme_minimal()+ coord_flip()
```

## Conclusion
- After going through many graphics and some calculations, we can summarize the "trend" of accidents in Monroe county as:

  + Accidents are likely to occur on October Friday afternoon. The peaked time is around 4 pm to 5 pm. 
  + Most of the crashes are the collision between two cars. The primary factor that leads to the impact is "Failure to yield the right of way."
