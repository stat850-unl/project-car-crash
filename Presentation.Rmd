## Topic Ideas: {.smaller}
- Some questions I want to find out through the data include:
  + Which year has the highest rate of accident? On what month? Is that month consistent for all other years? 
  + Is there any specific day (or month, year) with more accidents than the other day (month/ year)? 
  + On that day (month/ year), what is the primary factor that causes the accident? What are the highest injuries?
