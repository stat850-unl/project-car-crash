## Introduction

![](cc.jpg)

- The data I am using in this project is: Accidents recorded in Monroe County, Indiana, from 2003 to 2015. There are more than 53.000 observations and many variables. I am interested in some certain variables, like:
  + Day/ Month/ Year (that accidents occurred)
  + How many cars involved? (Collision type)
  + What kind of injuries they had? 
  + What is the primary reason that causes accidents to happen?

## Data

```{r load-sas-libraries, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}

library(SASmarkdown)
sas_enginesetup(sashtml=sashtml)

sasexe <- "C:/Program Files/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe"
sasopts <- "-nosplash -ls 75"

# Linux options (for grading, please leave this in!)
# sasexe <- "/usr/local/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/bin/sas_en"
# sasopts <- "-ls 75"
```

```{r, engine="sashtml", engine.path=sasexe, engine.opts=sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ODS HTML STYLE=HTMLBLUE;
filename dat "monroe-county-crash-data2003-to-2015.csv";
PROC IMPORT DATAFILE = dat OUT = Crash
    DBMS = CSV 
    REPLACE; 
    GETNAMES = YES;
    GUESSINGROWS = 5000;
RUN;
proc print data= Crash (obs=5);
var Year Month Day Collision_Type Injury_Type Primary_Factor;
