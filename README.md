## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and
push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This
will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures
all group members are working with the same repository.

Note that you must compile your readme (this document) for it to
properly display as part of your github repository.

Once you have received feedback on your project proposal (via Canvas)
you may alter this README so that it describes your final project
instead of the project proposal.

## Data Set

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-data/resource/e46a5cc5-ed4d-4b8d-b750-18e6c9ec570e

This data is about car crashes reported on Monroe County, Indiana, from 2003 to 2015. There are more than 53.000 observations, and many variables, like: Year, month, day (of the week), type of day (week day or weekend), hour (24 hour format), collision (how many cars involved), type of injuries, primary factors (that cause accident), location reported.


## Potential Topics to Explore Using the Data Set

Take a look at the accident by date (of the week), is there any different between week days and weekend? Look at the "total", then, look at each year to find the "trend", which year has the most accident?

Look at the factor causing the accidents, look at collision (how many cars involved?), is there any relation between the cars and the factors causing accident? 

For a better comparison, might look at the data in the 10 years range, it can be from 2003 - 2013, or 2005 - 2015.
